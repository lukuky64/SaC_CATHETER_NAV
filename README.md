# sensors_and_control
This project focuses on efficient 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces using an RGB-D camera and an EM tracking system. The process involves calibrating the EM sensor with the RGB-D camera, using the EM sensor for real-time pose estimation of the camera, and transforming and fusing point clouds into a global coordinate frame for a unified 3D model.
